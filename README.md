# Battlemage-Atlantis
This contains the C++ classes and current progress demo of my Unreal Engine 4 VR project "Battlemage Atlantis".

A brief description of Battlemage Atlantis:

BMA is a VR spellcasting game where specific hand movemnts relate to certain spells - thereby a spell will only be cast if the relevant movement was performed correctly.

The rules so far:

There are 3 types of spells: Basic, Elemental, Modifiers There are 4 basic spells: Wall, Ball, Beam, Atune (WIP) There are 5 elemtents: Energy (default spell type), Air (WIP), Water, Earth, Fire (WIP) There are 6 modifiers: Increase & decrease power, increase & decrease speed, explode, magnetic

Each base spell can hold a maximum of one element and one modifier

The storyplan:

It involves battles, mages and Atlantis - there is an awesome plan - Atlantis is a planet, more will not yet be revealed

A disclaimer for now:

Currently maximum recommended immersion time is 15min/hr - even I as a seasoned VR player have yet to get used to the motion sickness this game induces (WIP) Furthermore, I currently only have an Oculus Rift Headset with touch controllers so the game is not compatible with anything else at this stage - there are plans to open it up to more VR devices later on.

How to run the demo (Windows 10 x64 with Oculus Rift Touch only):
1. Download and extract the demo.zip from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QfayCM7-puQ_iQB6gfho4xXnElMgoZH6?usp=sharing
2. Startup Oculus
3. Run the "BattlemageAtlantis01.exe"
4. When you are done use 'alt + f4 key' combination to close the demo

The rules so far:
Hold A/X on the touch controller(s) to cast a spell (once complete let go of A/X)
Press trigger to launch the spell (aim with your hand)
Left thumbstick to move (not recommended) and right thumbstick to rotate view (also not recommended)
Though I am a seasoned VR player, motion sickness hits me after 15 minutes of playing this game - you have been warned.

Go and explore the various spell combinations that can be found on the demo tables, see which ones work
hint: you always need a base spell, and dual casting is not required (though it is possible) for the basic spells, only elements and modifiers.

My favourite combo so far: Beam with Earth & any modifier.

There are/is:
3 spell types - basic, elemental, modifier
4 basic spells - wall, ball, beam, atune
5 elements - energy (efault), air, water, earth, fire
6 modifiers - increase & decrease energy, increase & decrease duration/speed, explosive, magnetic
A storyline planned - it involves battles, mages and Atlantis (a planet) - more will be revealed 'later'

All work here is pre-alpha and will change drastically before completion - though the spellcasting mechanic is likely to remain... similar.
All very anticlimatic at the moment, but it's a start
