A brief description of Battlemage Atlantis:

BMA is a VR spellcasting game where specific hand movemnts relate to certain spells - thereby a spell will only be cast if the relevant movement was performed correctly.

The rules so far:

There are 3 types of spells: Basic, Elemental, Modifiers
There are 4 basic spells: Wall, Ball, Beam, Atune (WIP)
There are 5 elemtents: Energy (default spell type), Air (WIP), Water, Earth, Fire (WIP)
There are 6 modifiers: Increase & decrease power, increase & decrease speed, explode, magnetic

Each base spell can hold a maximum of one element and one modifier

The storyplan:

It involves battles, mages and Atlantis - there is an awesome plan - Atlantis is a planet, more will not yet be revealed

A disclaimer for now:

Currently maximum recommended immersion time is 15min/hr - even I as a seasoned VR player have yet to get used to the motion sickness this game induces (WIP)
Furthermore, I currently only have an Oculus Rift Headset so the game is not compatible with anything else at this stage - there are plans to open it up to more VR devices later on.
